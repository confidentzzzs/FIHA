# FIHA: Fine-grained Hallucinations Evaluations in Large Vision Language Models

## Project Description

FIHA (Fine-grained Hallucinations Evaluations) is a framework designed to evaluate the hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). The project aims to generate and evaluate question-answer pairs automatically without manual annotations, utilizing the Davidson Scene Graph (DSG) to structure the QA pairs. FIHA comprises four benchmarks derived from two datasets: MSCOCO and Foggy Cityscapes.

## Set up the environment:

The environment setup for FIHA relies on py-bottom-up-attention. Please follow the instructions in the environment setup repository to configure your environment in following link https://github.com/airsplay/py-bottom-up-attention.
