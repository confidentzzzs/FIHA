# FIHA: Fine-grained Hallucinations Evaluations in Large Vision Language Models

## Project Description

FIHA (Fine-grained Hallucinations Evaluations) is a framework designed to evaluate the hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). The project aims to generate and evaluate question-answer pairs automatically without manual annotations, utilizing the Davidson Scene Graph (DSG) to structure the QA pairs. FIHA comprises four benchmarks derived from two datasets: MSCOCO and Foggy Cityscapes.
